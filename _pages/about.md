My name is Bhavesh, I am an Applied Scientist.

My work focuses on applying Deep Learning to solve complex problems in **Computer Vision**. I have experience developing models for pulmonary nodule detection, self-driving perception, and diagnostic models for clinical decision support.

I am most proud of my Oral presentation at **CVPR 2024** for work I did during my internship at the Visual Computing Group, Cardiff University.

## Education & Background

I hold a **Dual Degree (B.Tech., M.Tech.) in Electrical Engineering** from **IIT Bombay**, graduating with a Cum. GPA of 8.66/10.

During my Master's Thesis, I proposed **ModSR**, a modular CNN framework for fast and adaptive super-resolution under real-world settings. I also wrote a paper for a journal that was rejected.

Outside of work, I love playing Tennis, reading, and learning new card tricks
